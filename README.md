# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-for-Future-ML-Implementation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The code allows players to compete against the computer and keeps track of wins, losses, and ties. The game results are saved to an Excel file, providing data for future machine learning (ML) implementation.

## The Excel Table and Headers
The game results are recorded in the Excel file with the following headers:

**• Game Number:** The number assigned to each game played.

**• Player Choice:** The choice made by the player (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

**• Computer Choice:** The randomly generated choice made by the computer.

**• Computer Result:** The result of the game for the computer (2 for a tie, 1 for a computer win, 0 for a computer loss).

The table in the Excel file stores the game data row by row, allowing for further analysis and utilization of the data.
## Requirements
**• Python 3**

**• openpyxl library** (for EXCEL interactions)

## How to Play
**1-Run the program using Python.**

**2-Choose R for Rock, P for Paper, or S for Scissors.**

**3-The computer will randomly select its choice.**

**4-The game will determine the outcome and display the result - whether it's a win, loss, or tie.**

**5-You will be prompted to play again or stop.**

**6-The game results will be saved to the "DATA.xlsx" file.(Make sure that the path in the code corresponds to the dataset placement).**

## Using the Data for Intelligence Development
The game results stored in the "DATA.xlsx" file can be utilized for intelligence development or analysis of gameplay patterns. By analyzing the data, you can uncover strategies, identify winning patterns, and improve your gameplay. You can perform data analysis, apply machine learning techniques, or create intelligent agents based on the recorded game results.


## File Structure

• `Rock, Paper, Scissors.py`: The main program file containing the game logic.

• `DATA.xlsx`: The Excel file used to store the game results.
